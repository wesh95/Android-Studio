-Pubhub final 2.zip: Group Final project that puts everything we learned together. It is intended to be like the app "Hooked" but for drink specials
		     It stores drink specials that bars can upload via an online form (https://test-d6497.firebaseapp.com/) into a firebase database.
		     The app will download the iformation from the data base and display the images, deal, description, and location via the google maps API.
